# ageulator

A plugin to calculate age from an input date (input via date picker) calculated against todays date.

This plugin has been created to test js skills learnt

Initial plugin needs some more work

TO DO - 

- Style the page 
- Clean up code with DRY principles
- Improve year calculation to give year + months and day age (eg 18years 3months and 2 days)
- Add seconds, hours, minutes and dynamically update based on current time
- Remove jQuery UI date picker and replace with 3 seperate fields for DD MM YY for usability reasons
